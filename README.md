## Soul Collector

# Core Fantasy

You run a soul shop. Sellers bring souls to offload, buyers come looking for specific vibes (tags).  The objective is to collect a full legendary set of souls.

# Pillars
	•	Shop: fast buy/sell decisions, simple UI.
	•	Collection depth: tags, eras, rarity, and conditions drive value.
	•	Active agency: auctions, brokers, expeditions, black market, rival trades(?)
	•	Risk & care: souls can fracture if mishandled; may need repair.

⸻

Moment-to-Moment Loop (One Day)
	1.	Open Shop: 3–5 encounters roll in (seller, buyer, broker).
	2.  Display & Curation: the shop has a limited number of display slots - only those can be sold.
	3.	Analyze Window: choose analyses (broad or deep) to run on souls in storage.
	4.	Special Opportunity: maybe an auction invite, black-market offer, or expedition.
	5.	Close & Upkeep: storage check (over-capacity risk), integrity decay, market price tick.

Win: assemble your Legendary Set.
